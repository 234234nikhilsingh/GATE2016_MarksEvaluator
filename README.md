# GATE2016_MarksEvaluator
A simple utility to find your GATE'16 CSE marks based on gateoverflow keys.

# http://gateoverflow.in/mymarks/

- The data logged is a (uid: marks) pair.
- Rank is not the GATE rank estimate. It just shows you your performance w.r.t other people who used this interface.
- Some answers are disputed, so take it with a pinch of salt.

So far, the keys for sets 1 and 2 from gateoverflow have been added. More will be added soon.
